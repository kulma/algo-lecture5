# Activities

## Task 1

Refer to the following link. Explain how the Knapsack Algorithm works:
https://monicagranbois.com/knapsack-algorithm-visualization/

> The Knapsack algorithm is about how to prioritize certain values / mathematical optimization. The algorithm has to maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of the weights is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity.

## Task 2

Refer to the following link. What are the difference between the brute force and the optimized solutions to the Knapsack problem.
https://www.educative.io/blog/0-1-knapsack-problem-dynamic-solution

> Brute-force solution evaluates the total weight and value of all possible subsets, then selects the subset with the highest value that is still under the weight limit. Optimized solution uses a two-dimensional array to store the results of all the solved sub-problems.

## Task 3

There are different implementations of the stair case problem in the following link:
https://www.enjoyalgorithms.com/blog/climbing-stairs-problem

Compare the time and space complexity of the different approaches



## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- Difference between divide and conquer and dynamic programming
- State some application of dynamic programming
- Difference between recursion vs dynamic programming
- Difference between Top down and bottom up approaches to dynamic programming
- How to solve a Dynamic Programming Problem?
